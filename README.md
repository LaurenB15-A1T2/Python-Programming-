This repository contains a small sampling of some programs I have developed and of models I have built in Python. It serves as an example of how I approach the iterative process of building machine learning models in Python, as well as how I implement methods such as modular coding to build simpler and more effective programs in Python. This repository is private and only intended to be viewed by potential future employers as some of the files I have selected to include in this repository were created based on assignments from courses taken while working on my MS in Data Science. All of the code written is entirely my own and showcases how I approach complex problems. Thus, I keep this work private to prevent future students who may be tasked with completing the same assignments I have provided from plagiarizing a portion or all of this body of work. Controlling who may view this work aligns me with Depaul University's Honor Code and allows me to encourage integrity in the community of Data Science students.
